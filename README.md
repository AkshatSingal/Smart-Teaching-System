# Smart-Teaching-System
This project aims to develop a smart teaching system tailored for primary school teachers and students, comprising two components: an alphabet recognition system utilizing motion gesture and a smart image generator. 
The alphabet recognition system will enable students to learn and practice the alphabet through gestures. By utilizing MNIST dataset training, the Keras library and OpenCV, this component offers a splendid educational experience that captivates young minds.
Complementing the alphabet recognition system, the smart image generator component empowers teachers with a powerful tool to generate visually compelling and customized educational graphics. By using ControlNet, a neural network architecture and an interactive whiteboard, this component can generate a wide range of high-quality images based on custom input to pique the curiosity of young learners.
